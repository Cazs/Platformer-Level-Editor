Level Editor for my 2D sidescroller platformer, this was initially for my 2nd year (2nd semester) Computer Science project.

  <li>Use WSAD keys to move the cursor when editing.</li>
  <li>Use WSAD to move the actor when simulating</li>
  <li>Click on blocks to select them in order to change their properties, i.e. weight, rigid body, etc.</li>
</ul>
